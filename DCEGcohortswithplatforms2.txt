NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study	Charles E. Matthews	"This is a prospective cohort study of diet and cancer in relation to several major cancers, especially breast, prostate, and colorectal malignancies. The cohort comprises 50-69 year-old male and female members of the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP). In 1995-6 we mailed baseline questionnaires to 3.5 million AARP members. Over 615,000 AARP members responded, with over 540,000 providing adequate dietary data. Preliminary analysis indicates that the cohort, both men and women, has the desired wide distributions of percent calories from fat, dietary fiber, fruits and vegetables, and red meat. Approximately 330,000 of the initial respondents (with satisfactory data) returned a second questionnaire containing questions on expsures not assessed in the first instrument. An end point ascertainment pilot study determined that cohort incidence rates for major cancers, determined from registry data, are consistent with SEER rates. Moreover, loss to follow-up would be small, causing neglibible bias in relatvie risk estimates."	https://dceg.cancer.gov/research/who-we-study/nih-aarp-diet-health-study

Agricultural Health Study	Jonathan Hofmann	"The Agricultural Health Study (AHS) is a prospective study of cancer and other health outcomes in a cohort of licensed pesticide applicators and their spouses from Iowa and North Carolina. The AHS began in 1993 with the goal of answering important questions about how agricultural, lifestyle and genetic factors affect the health of farming populations. The Agricultural Health Study is funded by the National Cancer Institute and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences in collaboration with the United States Environmental Protection Agency. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has previously played an important role in the study. More than 89,000 farmers and their spouses in Iowa and North Carolina have participated in the study. Their participation has provided, and continues to provide, the data that researchers need to help the current and future generations of farmers and their families live healthier lives."	https://aghealth.nih.gov/

"Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial"	Steven Moore	"The Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer (PLCO) Screening Trial is a large randomized trial to determine if screening for these cancers reduces mortality. The Trial is carried out by the NCI under contract with investigators at ten clinical centers in the United States. The study includes approximately 155,000 volunteers (recruited from 1993 through 2001, ages 55-74, equally distributed to the screening and control arms of the Trial). The PLCO Etiology and Early Markers Study (EEMS) supports etiologic and early detection studies of cancers and other conditions. This Study supports repository and informatics for EEMS and methods development work to maximize scientific value of the resource."	https://cdas.cancer.gov/plco/
